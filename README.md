# Lizzy

_Lizzy platform game_

So, this is my first platform game. I do the coding and creating all graphic assets. You're Lizzy, and you got a gatling gun. So yeah, the sky is the limit!

I actually wanted to make a game like this when in highschool. I was working with a friend who did the code while I did the graphics. Alas, it never finished. So now I thought I'd try a stab at the coding thing. I am using python with pygame and so far so good...

Use A and D to move. Use spacebar to jump. Use the mouse to aim, use left mousebutton to fire the gatling.
Use scroll wheel middle mousbutton to switch ammo types. Use right mousebutton to use the gatling for melee attacks

The level is small, mainly for testing. There is currently one type of simple enemy and I am working on adding more

Getting hit by enemies or explosions multiple times or falling in a hole will kill Lizzy, but currently she will respawn infinitely. 

Watch that recoil! It is quite substantial (depending on selected ammotype) :P

Oh yea, `chaingirl.py` is the main program. That might not be immediately obvious. ;)


### Installing dependencies

You can install required Python libraries by running:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do this from the repository root folder.
It's recommended to do this in a virtual Python environment,
to prevent the dependencies from interfering with other Python projects and their dependencies.
